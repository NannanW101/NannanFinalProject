Statistical Significance “Is our result unlikely to have occurred by random chance?” Helper vs. Hinderer Is 14/16 significantly higher than 8/16? Is 10/16 significantly higher than 8/16? Probability Long-run proportion of times an outcome from a random process occurs Probability Distribution- Pattern of long run outcomes 1.2 Definitions Sample: The set of observational units on which we collect data. Sample size: The number of observational units in the sample. Statistic: The number summarizing the result of the sample. Population: The complete collection of ALL elements that are of interest for a given problem. Parameter: The long-run numerical property of the process. Population and Sample: Use Statistics (observed from sample) to Estimate the Parameter (population unknown value). 1.3 Chance Models 1.3.1 Doris and Buzz Example 1.3.2 Coin Flipping Activity 1.4 Strength of Evidence 1.4.1 Rock-Paper-Scissors Example "],["what-is-statistics.html", "Chapter 2 What is Statistics", " Chapter 2 What is Statistics "]]
